      correctAnswer: "2",
      explanation:
        "- AVO oil is predominantly composed of monounsaturated fats, particularly oleic acid, which is a heart-healthy fatty acid. These fats are known to help reduce levels of bad cholesterol (LDL) while increasing levels of good cholesterol (HDL), thereby promoting heart health\n- AVO oil has a higher smoke point compared to sunflower oil. This means it can withstand higher temperatures before reaching its smoking point, making it suitable for high-heat cooking methods like frying and sautÃ©ing without undergoing oxidative damage or producing harmful compounds\n- AVO oil is often less processed compared to sunflower oil. Cold-pressed or unrefined avocado oil retains more of its natural nutrients and flavors compared to refined oils, which may undergo processes like bleaching and deodorizing that can strip away some of the oil's beneficial compounds.\n",
