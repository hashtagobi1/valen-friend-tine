          Honestly I just think you are great. In every capacity. You have many
          gifts and I love how you express all of them. I literally heard you
          sing once and was determined to make a connection out of you and we
          became such close friends.

          You have a unique way of bringing ppl together for a greater purpose.
          You are so silly and you make me laugh a lot. Your existence makes me
          happy and Iâ€™m overjoyed we get to share the earth as the same time as
          each other. Your beauty shines bright from the inside out into the
          world. The sun could never.
